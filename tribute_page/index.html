        <hr>
        <p>Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an 
            American industrialist, business magnate, founder of 
            the Ford Motor Company, and chief developer of the assembly line
             technique of mass production. By creating the first automobile that 
             middle-class Americans could afford, he converted the automobile 
             from an expensive luxury into an 
            accessible conveyance that profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century. </p>

            Henry Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in Greenfield Township, Michigan. His father,
             William Ford (1826–1905), was born in County Cork, Ireland, to a family that 
             had emigrated from Somerset, England in the 16th century.His mother, Mary Ford (née Litogot; 1839–1876), was born in Michigan as the youngest child of Belgian immigrants; her parents died when she was a child and she was adopted by neighbors, the O'Herns. Henry Ford's siblings were Margaret Ford (1867–1938);
             Jane Ford (c. 1868–1945); William Ford (1871–1917) and Robert Ford (1873–1934).
             Michigan. At 15, Ford dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends
              and neighbors dozens of times, gaining the reputation of a watch repairman.
               In 1879, He left home to work as an apprentice machinist in Detroit, 
               first with James F. Flower & Bros., and later with the Detroit Dry Dock Co. 
               He married Clara Jane Bryant
             on April 11, 1888 and supported
              himself by farming and running a 
              sawmill. They had one child: Edsel Ford

                        where the Michigan Building now stands, Ford put the finishing touches on his pure
                        ethanol-powered motor. After more than two years of experimentation, Ford at the age of 32, had completed
                        his first experimental automobile. he dubbed his creation the "Quadricycle",so named because it ran on four bicycle tires, and because of the means
                        through which th engine drove the back wheels.

                            prototype, Ford sold the Quadricycle in order
                             to continue building other vehicles. He received
                              backing from various investors over the next seven years,
                               some of whom formed the Detroit Automobile Company
                                (later the Henry Ford Company) in 1899. His partners, eager 
                                to put a passenger car on the market, grew frustrated with Ford’s 
                                constant need to improve, and Ford left his namesake company in
                                 1902. (After his departure, it was reorganized as the Cadillac 
                                 Motor Car Company.) The following year, Ford established the Ford Motor Company.

                                Ford was a pioneer of "welfare capitalism", 
                                designed to improve the lot of his workers and 
                                especially to reduce the heavy turnover that had many
                                 departments hiring 300 men per year to fill 100 slots. 
                                 Efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers.
                                
                                Ford astonished the world in 1914 by offering a 
                                $5 per day wage ($140 today), which more than 
                                doubled the rate of most of his workers

In addition to raising his workers' wages, Ford also 
introduced a new,
 reduced workweek in 1926. The decision 
was made in 1922, when Ford and Crowther described it as 
six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week, but in 1926 it
 was announced as five 8-hour days,
 giving a 40-hour week. The program apparently started
